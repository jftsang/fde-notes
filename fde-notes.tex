Notes by Jonathan Michael Foonlan Tsang}

\maketitle

These notes are primarily based on the course as it was given in Michaelmas 2014
by Stuart Dalziel and Nathalie Vriend, or on the Michaelmas 2015 version by
Dalziel, Vriend and Andy Woods. The headings in the table of contents reflect
the official structure of the course, except in \S\ref{section-nmv}. An asterisk
denotes a section which was either not lectured or not examinable in 2014, but
this will not necessarily be true for other years.

In the past, this course was known as `Geophysical and Environmental Fluid
Dynamics', `Environmental Fluid Dynamics', or a variety of other names.
