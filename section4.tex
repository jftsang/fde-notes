\chapter{Jets, plumes and thermals} \label{section4}

A \textit{jet} is a continuous directed release of fluid with a specified
momentum from an isolated source (such as blowing from lips). A \textit{plume}
is a continuous release of buoyant fluid from an isolated source, with, ideally,
no mass or momentum flux (e.g. a candle). The direction of a plume is given by
$\bs{g}$. A \textit{thermal} is an isolated release of a finite patch of
buoyancy.

Note that `continuous', `stable' and `steady' are distinct terms, and no one of
them implies either of the other. 

We will assume that jets and plumes are axisymmetric and self-similar, so that
any averaged quantity $\bar\phi$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \bar\phi = \Phi(z) f(r/b)
\end{equation}
where $b$ is the `radius' of the plume. The averaging may be an ensemble average
or a temporal average. Specific forms for the function $f$ may be taken. The
simplest form for $f$ is the \textit{top-hat} profile
\begin{equation}
 f(x) = \begin{cases} 
  0 & \text{if } x>1\\
  1 & \text{if } x<1.
 \end{cases}
\end{equation} 
Other forms, such as the Gaussian $f(x) = \exp(-x^2)$, may also be used.
