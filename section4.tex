\section{Particle-laden and granular flow}

We consider the flow of a current consisting of a fluid with a well-mixed
suspension of particles, with the particles denser than the fluid. The
difference in density means that \textit{buoyancy} has a role to play. The flow is
driven by a pressure gradient and affected by the effects of buoyancy. Viscosity
is negligible, so buoyancy and inertia balance each other. 

Particles can settle out of suspension (\textit{sedimentation}) or be \textit{entrained}
into suspension. This means the concentration of the particles in the suspension
changes. So the density difference between the suspension and the ambient fluid
changes too. 

\subsection{Types of particulate flows}

We model four types of particulate gravity currents. The models are ad-hoc and
apply to different geophysical situations, where different assumptions may be
made about the flows and the particles:

\paragraph{Grain suspension by fluid turbulence} Examples include pyroclastic
flows
%\footnote{Wikipedia: A pyroclastic flow is a fast-moving current of hot gas and
%rock (collectively known as tephra), which reaches speeds moving away from a
%volcano of up to 700 km/h (450 mph). The gas can reach temperatures of about
%1,000\deg C. Pyroclastic flows normally hug the ground and travel downhill, or
%spread laterally under gravity. Their speed depends upon the density of the
%current, the volcanic output rate, and the gradient of the slope. They are a
%common and devastating result of certain explosive volcanic eruptions.}
, turbidity currents
\footnote{Wikipedia: A turbidity current is a current of rapidly moving,
sediment-laden water moving down a slope through water, or another fluid. The
current moves because it has a higher density than the fluid through which it
flows—the driving force of a turbidity current derives from its sediment, which
renders the turbid water denser than the clear water above. The deposit of a
turbidity current is called a turbidite.}
and powder snow
\footnote{Wikipedia: Freshly fallen, uncompacted snow. The density and moisture
content of powder snow can vary widely; snowfall in coastal regions and areas
with higher humidity is usually heavier than a similar depth of snowfall in an
arid or continental region. Light, dry (low moisture content, typically 4–7\%
water content) powder snow is prized by skiers and snowboarders. It is often
found in the Rocky Mountains of North America and in most regions in Japan.}. 
In such flows, the particles may be very concentrated and denser than the fluid, but
they are kept in suspension by the turbulent flow of the fluid; any particles
which settle quickly undergo \textit{resuspension}.

\paragraph{Liquefied and fluidised flow} Examples include dense snow avalanches
and \textit{some} mudflows. In these cases, the flow is dominant and the
particles move with the flow; in this regime, particles do not interact with
each other (\textit{cohesionlessness}), as they are separated from each other
(\textit{grain dispersion})). Their effect is to increase the viscosity of the
fluid. However, this limits the possibility of turbulence, and so particles can 
settle out at the base of the fluid.

\paragraph{Dry grain flow and interactions} Examples include sand dune
avalanches and rock slides. Now the particles interact with each other,
colliding fequently; the fluid acts as a lubricant. 

\paragraph{Grain-supported matrix} Examples include debris flows and lahars, or
large boulders suspended in a muddy matrix. Now cohesion has a large r\^ole to
play. The flow of mud and slurries are non-Newtonian. Effects of cohesion,
friction, pore pressure, etc. may be modelled using other stress-shear rate
relationships (\textit{rheological models}), including power laws, Bingham
plastic models nad Herschel-Bulkley models. In the latter two models, the fluid
has a \textit{yield strength}: a minimum shear stress must be applied before any
flow occurs. 

\subsection{Modelling a particulate gravity current}



\subsection{Physics within a particle gravity current}

A particle gravity current can be modelled as having a main body and a base. In
the main body, there is a well-mixed suspension of particles in a turbulent
flow; in the base, the particles and fluid have low velocity and particles are
settling out. 

Let
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\rho_0$ denote the density of the fluid;
 \item $\mu_0$ denote the viscosity of the fluid;
 \item $\rho_p$ denote the density of the particles;
 \item $\phi$ denote the concentration of particles.
\end{itemize}
Then the \textit{bulk density} of the fluid-particle mixture is
\begin{equation}
    \rho_l = \rho_0 + \phi (\rho_p - \rho_0) 
\end{equation}
and the \textit{reduced gravity} is
\begin{equation}
 g' = g \frac{\rho_l - \rho_0}{\rho_0} = \phi g \frac{\rho_p - \rho_0}{\rho_0} = \phi g_0'
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    g_0' = g \frac{\rho_p - \rho_0}{\rho_0}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Sedimenting particle-laden flows}

We now assume that particles are small compared to the scale of motion, so that
the presence of an individual particle has a negligible effect on the bulk flow.
However, the collective of particles will have an effect. We also assume that
particles sediment slowly, over a timescale much larger than that of the flow;
and that particles are numerous and well-mixed, so that we can talk of the
`concentration' of particles, rather than having to study individual particles.

Although we use the word `particles', this theory could just as well apply to
bubbles or to droplets; a bubble can be regarded as a particle with density
negligible compared to that of the fluid; the reduced gravity is negative.

The suspension changes the bulk properties of the fluid. As discussed, the 
suspension has density
\begin{equation}
        \rho_l = \rho_0 + \phi (\rho_p - \rho_0).
\end{equation}
The viscosity of the suspension is given by a power law
\begin{equation}
 \mu = \mu_0 \left( 1 - \frac{\phi}{\phi_{max}} \right)^{-n \phi_{max}}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{max}$ is the maximum suspension concentration that can be
supported. For spherical particles, $n = \frac{5}{2}$.

Particles settle towards the bottom at some settling velocity $u_s$ which we
will determine. Let $D$ denote the particle diameter. We define the
\textit{particle Reynolds number}
\begin{equation}
    Re_p = \frac{\rho_l D u_s}{\mu}
\end{equation}
which governs many properties of the flow.

When particles sediment out of suspension, we are left with a \textit{clarified}
fluid, devoid of particles, and a concentrated suspension at the bottom where
all the particles gather. Sedimenting flows are classified into four types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type I: Free settling of individual particles
    \item Type II: Flocculant settling: Coaleescence of particles
    \item Type III: Hindered (zone) settling: Restricted, fluid motion
    \item Type IV: Compression settling: Mechanical support
\end{itemize}
We will discuss Types I and III in detail.

\subsubsection{Type I: Free settling of individual particles} 

This occurs when particles are very well-separated from each other, and may be
treated independently of each other.

\paragraph{The particle Reynolds number} When a sphere of diameter $D$ moves at
a speed $u_s$ through otherwise unmoving fluid, its behaviour depends on the
particle Reynolds number $Re_p=\frac{\rho_lDu_s}{\mu}$.  If $Re_p\ll 1$ then the
flow past the sphere is \textit{laminar}; the sphere travels smoothly. But if
$10^3 \ll Re_p \ll 2\cdot10^5$ then the flow is in the \textit{inertial regime};
the sphere travels roughly, and the boundary layer is turbulent. 

Various other regimes are possible for different values of $Re_p$; they are
discussed in Middleton and Southard (1984). 

\paragraph{The drag coefficient} By dimensional analysis, the drag $F_D$ on a
particle travelling at $u_s$ through a fluid must be proportional to
$\frac{1}{2}\rho_lu_s^2A_p$:
\begin{equation}
 F_D = C_D\frac{1}{2}\rho_lu_s^2A_p
\end{equation}
where $A_p$ is the planar area of the particle. (See Prandtl and Tietjens, 1957
for details.) The dimensionless coefficient $C_D$ is called the \textit{drag
coefficient}, and depends on the Reynolds number. The dependence may be found
empirically:
\begin{itemize}
 \item When $Re_p\ll1$, then $C_D$ is inversely proportional to $Re_p$:
\begin{equation}
    C_D = \frac{24}{Re_p}
\end{equation}
 \item When $0.2 < Re_p < 10^3$, there is a transitional region.
 \item When $10^3 < Re_p < 2\cdot10^5$, $C_D$ is approximately constant for
     cylinders, spheres and discs. For these shapes, $C_D \approx 0.44$.
 \item At $Re_p\approx2\cdot10^5$, the drag coefficient drops very quickly before
     increasing much more slowly again. This is called the \textit{drag crisis
     regime}, and arises because of a flow separation.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The settling velocity} So what is the settling velocity $u_s$?
We consider the momentum balance on a particle in suspension. The forces acting
on the particle are drag, buoyancy and gravity, and so:
\begin{align}
    m\frac{du}{dt} &= F_g - F_b - F_D \\
    F_D            &= C_D\frac{1}{2}\rho_lu^2A_p \\
    F_b            &= \rho_lgV \\
    F_g            &= \rho_pgV
\end{align}
where $V$ is the volume of the particle. The expression for $F_b$ is given by
Archimedes' law: the buoyancy force is $g$ times the mass of fluid displaced.
(Note that the fluid displaced is assumed to have density $\rho_l$ rather than
$\rho_0$, even though we are assuming that particles are well-separated from
each other and do not interact!) Setting $\frac{du}{dt} = 0$ and solving for $u$
gives us the terminal velocity, which is the settling velocity.

For a sphere of diameter $D$, we have $V = \frac{1}{6}\pi D^3$ and $A_p =
\frac{1}{4}\pi D^2$, and so
\begin{equation}
    u_s=\sqrt{\frac{4g(\rho_p-\rho_l)D}{3C_D\rho_l}}.
\end{equation}
Recall that in the Stokes regime $Re_p < 0.2$, we have $C_D=\frac{24}{Re_p}$. Hence:
\begin{align}
    F_D &= 3\pi u_s \mu D \\
    u_s &= \frac{g(\rho_p-\rho_l)D^2}{18\mu}
\end{align}
with $u_s \propto D^2$ and dependent on $\mu$. 

But in the inertial, turbulent regime, with $10^3 < Re_p < 2\cdot10^5$, we have
that $C_D=0.44$ is constant, and 
\begin{align}
    F_D &= 0.055\pi\rho_lu_s^2D^2 \\
    u_s &= 1.74\sqrt{\frac{g(\rho_p-\rho_l)D}{\rho_l}}
\end{align}
with $u_s \propto D^{1/2}$ and not dependent on $\mu$.

These predictions are confirmed by observations: the Stokes regime holds for
fine grains such as silt, whereas the inertial regime holds for very coarse
sand, granules and pebbles (provided that particle-particle interactions may be
neglected). However, for $D$ between 0.1mm and 1mm (such as for medium or coarse
sand), neither the Stokes nor the turbulent predictions hold well. Many
equations have been proposed to describe the intermediate region, including the
\textit{Ferguson-Church equation}.  \footnote{See
\url{http://hinderedsettling.com/2013/08/09/grain-settling-python/}.}

\paragraph{Advection and diffusion of particles} The concentration of particles
$\phi$ is governed by an advection-diffusion equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\phi = D\nabla^2\phi
\end{equation}
where $D$ now denotes a diffusion coefficient, \textit{not} the particle
diameter. The particle velocity $\mathbf{u}$ is equal to the velocity of the
fluid, plus the settling velocity:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{u} = (u, v, w) + (0, 0, -u_s).
\end{equation}
In the particular case of no background fluid flow, $\mathbf{u} = (u,v,w)$ and
the advection-diffusion equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} - u_s\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial z} = D\nabla^2\phi
\end{equation}

The diffusion coefficient $D$ depends on $Re_p$ and whether the flow is laminar
or turbulent. In the laminar regime, diffusion of particles is due to molecular
(Brownian) diffusion: 
\begin{equation}
    D = D_B \sim \frac{kT}{6\pi\mu r}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the radius of particles, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is
the temperature. Molecular diffusion is a very slow process unless $r$ is very
small, such as for aerosol particles.

However, in the turbulent regime, diffusion of particles is due to turbulent
diffusivity:
\begin{equation}
    D = D_t \sim u^\star h
\end{equation}
where $u^\star = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_b}{\rho}}$ is the shear velocity (friction
velocity), $\tau_b$ is the shear stress at the bottom, and $h$ is some length
scale, such as the distance from the bottom.

\subsubsection{Type III: Hindered (zone) settling}

When there are many particles, then particles no longer settle at $u_s$ but at
some slower velocity, $u_h$, which depends on $\phi$ and on $u_s$.
