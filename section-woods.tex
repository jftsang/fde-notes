\chapter{Buoyancy-driven flows} \label{section-woods}

In these lectures we will consider flows which are turbulent, driven by
buoyancy, and possibly containing several phases, such as suspensions of ash in
air.  Turbulence is important because it is ubiquitous, and is responsible for
mixing.

Jets, plumes and fountains are three different types of such things.

We will try to model phenomena such as volcanic plumes, which rise turbulently
for twenty or thirty kilometres. A volcanic plume is able to rise so high
because it starts off with plenty of thermal energy, not just kinetic energy (as
for a jet).
